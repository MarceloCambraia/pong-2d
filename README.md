# Pong 2D

This is a simple 2D Pong game, developed as a project to practice game development concepts.

## About the Game

Pong 2D is a recreation of the classic Pong game, where one or two players control paddles to bounce the ball. The goal is to prevent the ball from passing your paddle.

## Technologies Used

### Programming Language
C#

### Library/Engine
Unity

## How to Run

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/MarceloCambraia/pong-2d.git

Run the game:

If running from Unity Editor, open Unity and load the project.

If using the built version, navigate to the Build folder and run the executable (Pong2D.exe on Windows or the equivalent for your OS).

## How to Play

Player 1 Controls: Use the W and S keys to move the paddle up and down.

Player 2 Controls: Use the Up Arrow and Down Arrow keys to move the paddle up and down.

CPU Mode: Press Space to switch Player 2 back to CPU control.

## How It Was Programmed
The game logic includes collisions between the ball, walls and the paddles.

Controls allow each player to move their paddle up and down.

The game automatically starts against the CPU.

The ball's speed increases as the game progresses.
